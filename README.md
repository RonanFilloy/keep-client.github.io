This application is a simplified google keep clone. It allows you to write notes, archive and eliminate them, and of course change them as you deem necessary. There is also the posibility of filtering them according to the tags you add.

The Note creation is based off google keep's where until youy start writing a note you will not be able to see the full creation form, this is for design purposes since the full form can occupy too much space when it is not being used.

All of the data is kept in a postgresql database and the entire backend (as well as the db itself) is being hosted on render. This part of the app (the frontend) is currently live at the following url in case you want to give it a try:

Enjoy!
